# powershell-firefox-prefsjs
A powershell script that modifies your default Firefox preferences file (Prefs.js) based on a modification file template.

## Disclaimer
This script can modify the Prefs.js file which is not intended by Mozilla.
The creation and modification of the user.js file will be implemented later as an option.

As usual, you are using this script as your own risks (Even if a backup of your current config is made by the script ;) )
